Current detected bugs in project:
1) The program does not initialize if the user edits incorrectly a file
from the tracker_info directory.
2) The "Display in graphical form" button was disabled due to the
fact that QtCharts did not want to display any graph windows when
the total number of graph points saved in the tracker was less than 2.
Above this number, the button is re enabled.
3) If the program is executed from another directory, the program
will lose its saved data because the program would not be able
to find an existing tracker_info directory. If the program is unable
to find an existing tracker_info directory, it will create a new one
that is empty.
4) Program crashes when the user enters a reserved character for file paths such
as '/' '\' and ':'. '/' and '\' were handled, but ':' is still remaining to be
handled.
